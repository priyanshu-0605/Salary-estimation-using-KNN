# Salary-estimation-using-KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm used for predicting salaries based on similar profiles. It works by comparing a person's details—like age, education, and work experience—with others in a dataset. Then it finds the “k” most similar cases and averages their salaries to estimate the new one. Simple, yet surprisingly powerful!

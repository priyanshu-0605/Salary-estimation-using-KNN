# Salary-estimation-using-KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm used for predicting salaries based on similar profiles. It works by comparing a person's details‚Äîlike age, education, and work experience‚Äîwith others in a dataset. Then it finds the ‚Äúk‚Äù most similar cases and averages their salaries to estimate the new one. Simple, yet surprisingly powerful!

 How Salary Estimation Works with KNN
Input Features: Age, education level, years of experience, job role, hours worked per week, etc.

Training Data: A dataset of individuals with known salaries and features.

Distance Metric: KNN calculates the "distance" between the new data point and all others in the dataset (commonly using Euclidean distance).

Neighbor Selection: It selects the k closest data points (neighbors) to the new input.
Prediction: For regression, KNN takes the average salary of those k neighbors and uses it as the predicted salary.

 Steps in a Typical KNN Salary Estimation Pipeline
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values
Encode categorical variables
Normalize or scale features

Train-Test Split:
Divide data into training and testing sets

Model Training:
Choose an optimal value of k (often via cross-validation)
Fit the model using training data

Prediction:
Predict salary for new individuals based on their features

Evaluation:
Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R¬≤ score to assess performance

üìå Example Use Case
Imagine you have a dataset of employees with features like:

plaintext
Age | Education Level | Experience | Hours/Week | Salary
---------------------------------------------------------
30  | Bachelor's      | 5 years    | 40         | ‚Çπ6,00,000
To estimate the salary of a new employee, KNN finds the most similar profiles and averages their salaries to make a prediction.
